Title: High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis Using R-squared Measure for Binary Outcomes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zhiyu Kang <kang0412@umn.edu>
Description: Provides methods for estimating the total mediation effect in high-dimensional 
  case-control studies using an R-squared based measure. This approach accounts for 
  ascertainment bias, weak mediators, and bidirectional effects using a cross-fitted, 
  modified Haseman-Elston regression-based estimation procedure. The package includes 
  functions for mediator selection, variance component estimation, and total mediation 
  effect computation.
